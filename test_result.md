# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

(2) POST /api/users/me/check-in - use a NEWLY REGISTERED user so first call has already_checked_in:false and coins_awarded>=15, second call already_checked_in:true and coins_awarded:0, coins total consistent.

      message: "Implemented new POST /api/rooms/{room_id}/share-to-moments endpoint for repeatable room sharing. Host can share live room to moments multiple times. Added authorization (only host), private room check, and integration with existing _share_room_to_moments function. Please test: (1) Room creation without share_to_moments - no moment created. (2) Host shares room via endpoint - moment created with is_live=true. (3) Share again - second moment created (repeatable). (4) Non-host tries to share - 403. (5) User joins and raises hand - hand_raised=true. (6) Host changes role to speaker - hand_raised resets to false. (7) Host ends room - moments show is_live=false. Use mei@demo.com and diego@demo.com credentials."

(2) ✅ Host shared room via POST /api/rooms/{room_id}/share-to-moments - returned 201 with {shared: true}, moment created with is_live=true and correct title. (3) ✅ Second share created second moment - repeatable sharing works (2 moments total for same room). (4) ✅ Non-host (diego) correctly rejected with 403 'Only the host can share this room'. (5) ✅ User B joined room and raised hand - hand_raised=true, role='listener' verified in room details. (6) ✅ Host changed User B role to 'speaker' - role updated and hand_raised reset to false. (7) ✅ Host ended room - both moments now show is_live=false (computed live from room state). (8) ✅ GET /api/moments returns room field with live state computed at read-time via _room_card. (9) ✅ All authorization, state management, and live computation working correctly. NO CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND. Feature ready for production."

Test with Diego Ramírez conversation (24 seeded messages). (2) Connect page: Daily Phrase card removed, partner list starts directly. (3) Profile preview language section reverted to OLD design (code + underline + dots + name below, NOT pill/chip style with flags). Test with Emma Wilson's profile."

      message: "✅ ALL 3 UI FIXES VERIFIED (3/3 passed). Tested on mobile viewport (390x844) with mei@demo.com. TEST 1 (MOST IMPORTANT) - Chat scrolling fix ✅: (A) Chat opens pinned at BOTTOM showing newest message 'Reply 12 from Diego' without manual scrolling. (B) Scrolled up to middle messages (7-10 visible), waited 3 seconds, list stayed in place with NO auto-jump to bottom. (C) While scrolled up, typed and sent 'hello scroll test', list immediately snapped to bottom showing new message. All three scroll behaviors working correctly. TEST 2 - Connect page ✅: NO 'PHRASE OF THE DAY' gradient card present. Partner list starts directly with 6 partner cards. Daily Phrase card successfully removed. TEST 3 - Profile preview ✅: Emma Wilson's profile shows OLD column style language section: EN code with green underline + 'English' label below (native), swap arrow, JA/KO codes with proficiency dots (4-5px circles) + 'Japanese'/'Korean' labels below. Text small and tidy (11.5px/9.5px). NOT pill/chip style with flag icons. Stats card shows labeled cells: Streak, Moments, Followers, Following, Learning, Badges. Console: only minor warning 'props.pointerEvents is deprecated' (non-blocking). NO CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND. All UI fixes working as specified."
