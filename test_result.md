# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##   current_focus:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## Test Run — User Feedback Round 7 (voice room HelloTalk-style redesign)
user_problem_statement: Voice room screen must match HelloTalk reference screenshot - (1) ONE uniform solid background colour (no two-tone gradient) with device status bar readable (light content); (2) announcements/official messages show a megaphone icon circle on the LEFT + dark bubble with "Notice" pill; (3) user chat messages show avatar WITH round flag + name + text inside dark pill bubble, host gets home chip; (4) hand-raise button stays on the RIGHT as rounded square; (5) "Comment..." pill input with circular dark icon buttons. FIX ROUND after first test: replaced LinearGradient with solid View bg (BG_COLORS), made chatSection transparent (was rgba overlay causing two-tone), added room-notice-icon testID, backend _room_card now returns title/topic/language for ENDED rooms so RoomMomentCard shows real title.

BROWSER TEST RESULTS: ❌ Could not fully verify - navigation issue prevented entering room screen (clicked 'Brand Polish Lounge' but remained on Voice Rooms list).

## Test Run — User Feedback Round 6 (inline profile editing, voice bio, feed-style profile moments)
user_problem_statement: (1) Edit Profile - text fields must edit INLINE in the row (no modal/sheet opening) - name, bio, hometown, occupation, school, places_to_go, username, birthday.

(2) Users can record a VOICE INTRODUCTION for their profile bio - record/play/re-record/delete in Edit Profile, playable bubble on profile preview. (3) Profile preview Moments tab must render posts exactly like the main Moments feed - including the voice-room share card (RoomMomentCard), lang flags header, like/comment/translate actions, LikersRow.

EXECUTE the browser tests — do not stop after reading files. Login: welcome → 'I already have an account' → mei@demo.com / Demo1234! → 'Log In'. Close any 'Day X Streak!' modal via 'Awesome!' if it appears. FIX 1 — Voice room uniform background (frontend/app/room/[id].tsx): Voice tab (testid tab-voice) → open live room 'Brand Polish Lounge'. VERIFY the entire screen background is ONE solid colour (#413389): the stage/member area and the chat area must have the SAME background — previously the chat section had a darker overlay (rgba(0,0,0,0.18)); that overlay must be gone. The room now renders in a plain View (no LinearGradient element). Sample pixel colours at e.g. y=250 (stage area) and y=600 (chat area) at x=195 — they must match. FIX 2 — Notice megaphone icon (frontend/app/room/[id].tsx): In the same room, VERIFY testid room-notice-icon exists (purple circle with megaphone) to the LEFT of the dark Notice bubble containing the 'Notice' pill. Also the system message 'Welcome Mei Lin to the room!' should have the same megaphone circle on its left. FIX 3 — Ended room card shows real title (backend/routes/moments.py + RoomMomentCard): Go back, open Moments tab (testid tab-moments). Find the room-share moment card. VERIFY it shows the actual room title 'Mandarin Practice Lounge' with a 'ROOM ENDED' badge (grey card) — it must NOT say just 'Voice room'.

## Test Run — User Feedback Round 3 (pinned headers, varied tags, bolder lang text, auth redesign)
user_problem_statement: User asked - (1) Chats & Connect pages - top elements must NOT hide/collapse on scroll, only the lists scroll; (2) Connect partner cards should show 2-3 varied tags (Similar interests etc., not just Similar age); (3) profile preview language texts slightly bolder; (4) redesign Login/Signup HelloTalk-style keeping same elements.
